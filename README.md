# Hello

My the name is Nelly Wambui, a student of life who has evolved beautifully in the science world.
I did my undergraduate studies, Bachelor of Science in Medical Biochemistry, at Jomo Kenyatta UNiversity of Agriculture and Technology.
Bioinformatics is quickly becoming something to love as it has very well been introduced to me here at ICIPE, it almost feels like the
introduction i had before was nothing as it was shallow. This will be one of those cases one would say, "I came out way much better as 
compared to how I came in."
Once done with the internship, and doing my projects well, it is my wish to further my studies in bioinformatics after this internship.
It is so good to do science projects with the awesome technology the world is lucky to have, and not necessarily needing to go to the wet lab.
